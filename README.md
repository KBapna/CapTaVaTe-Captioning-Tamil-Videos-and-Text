# Auto-Caption
This project is designed to automate the process of adding Tamil subtitles to videos. The program takes a video file, transcribes the spoken words into text using the Whisper API, translates the text into Tamil using the Google Cloud Translate API, and then adds the Tamil text as subtitles to the video using MoviePy. This process saves time and effort for anyone looking to add subtitles to their videos.
